# My first React project

## Project description
	I will try to create a small news application in which you can add / delete / edit and also find news, as well as 
	see the news "more" and "comments"

## Local server with Node.js and express

	If you do not have Node.js installed, then you need to download and install it from official 
	website (https://nodejs.org/).
	
	1. Open command line and go to project root
	2. Install express with command "npm install express --save-dev"
	3. Run sever with command "npm start"
	4. Look into the browser - http://localhost:3000
